# Targeting Power-Middle Influencers


## with graph analysis and sentiment analysis

Check out the source code for this project [here](https://github.com/sdmirch/instagram-influencer-graph).

### tl;dr
I identified the top power-middle influencers on Instagram using graph and sentiment analysis. Power-middle influencers have a devoted following and tend to have a higher interaction rate with their followers, and therefore can make more authentic and affordable endorsements of niche products.
