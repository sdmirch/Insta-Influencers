# Targeting Power-Middle Influencers


## with graph analysis and sentiment analysis

Check out the source code for this project [here](https://github.com/sdmirch/instagram-influencer-graph).

**This project page is currently under construction.**

### tl;dr
Power-Middle influencers on Instagram are a more effective and authentic option for marketing niche products to targeted communities. I created a methodology to select, construct, and analyze community networks within Instagram. Elite Power-Middle influencers were identified using social centrality measures and sentiment analysis of captions. Technologies used include Python, NetworkX, MongoDB, Selenium, and vaderSentiment.

## Top Influencers
-  Critical Mass Filter: Must have more than 5000 followers.

- Influence Score: Eigenvector centrality.

- Authenticity Score: Inversely proportional to positive sentiment in captions.
